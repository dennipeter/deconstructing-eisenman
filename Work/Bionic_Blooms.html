                            Bionic Blooms is an interactive art installation that mimics floral blooms. It was designed in collaboration with "Digital Intuition" as part of an academic excercise at the Crescent School of Architecture. 
                            The brief was to design an interactive installation that would involve the students of the university and expose the students to technologies and fabrication processes outside the immediate realm of architecture (yet closely linked to design and architecture). 
                            Developing the mechanism of the bloom was an iterative process where we explored the best possible dynamics we could achieve while keeping in mind the limitations of the motors that were readily available in the market.
                            During the four-week brainstorming session on the design and development of the installation, we engaged with a variety of techniques with the students including 3D printing, computer vision, computational design and programming & interfacing with microcontrollers.

                            The design process of the mechanism was an iterative process where we tried various different mechanisms, materials, motors and sizes. It was clear from the beginning that we would use servo motors for the mechanism - primarily since it was musch easier to implement from an electrical point of view, but also becuase of its cost and ability to self correct. While stepper motors would have been ideal for long term use,
                            it's lack of self correction (without a rotary encoder), higher initial costs and complex wiring/power systems would prove to be too complicated to implement within the allocated time that we had to set up the installation. We ended up choosing the MG996 servo motor with approximately 9.4kg/cm of torque, and the mechanism was based upon the specifications of this particular motor.

                            <br>  
                            For the control electronics, we used the Arduino MEGA. With upto 15 PWM pins, each MEGA could control upto 15 servo motors, and hence we had 6 MEGA's controlling 90 motors. The arduinos are all connected to a single PC and receives control data via USB serial. While ethernet cables would be the preffered way to handle data output from the computer - for upto 6 slave devices, and for the lengths of cable involved in this particular install, USB cables proved to be sufficient and easier to implement.

                            The development of the mechanics itself was all based on the type of motor that we decided on. Once we had decided to use servo motors, we were limited to around 180 degrees of rotational motion. With some nifty experiments with varying gear mechanisms, we had arrived at the current design. It uses a combination of radial and linear gear systems to simultaneously rotate 4 prongs. 
                            For the design of the petals, we explored various flexible materials and even explored the possibility of using compliant mechanisms to design a visually rigid yet foldable structure. We looked at everything from origami folds to designing our own micro-hinged mechanisms for the folds. But ultimately we arrived at using cardboard paper along with vinyl stickers on either side to give it the flexibility and the long term durability. We were extremely happy with how it performed and even more so, how it looked.
                            
                            The colour scheme that we used for the petals was computationally generated and the fabrication for the same was also optimised using computational algorithms in Grasshopper. To reduce material wastage and time during laser cutting, we employed packing algorithms for maximum efficiency.

                            The framework for the mechanics were optimised to be 3D printed in parts. The initial prototype for the mechanism consits of 11 individual printed parts which were hand assembled with fasteners. The design for this mechanism is still under development - primarily to
                            reduce hand assembly times, but also to increase the longetivity of the parts after observing possible points of failure from wear and tear. The ultimate goal would be to develop injection moulded parts which can considerably help reduce the production time (but at the expense of much higher initial development costs).
                            We also made use of a CO2 laser cutter to cut the MDF panels (which served as a base to mount the mechanisms in groups of 4) as well as to cut the pieces of carboard which served as the petals of the bloom.
